# what is a script
A script is a series of instructions that a
computer can follow to achieve a goal.    
To write a script, you need to first state your goal and then list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it.   
Some of the scripts you will be reading or writing
when you have fin ished this book will be quite
complicated and might look intimidating at first. However, a script is just a series of short instructions, each of which is performed in order to solve the problem in hand. This is why creating a script is like writing a recipe or manual that allows a computer to solve a puzzle one step at a time.   
## steps for building your first JS webpage
* Define the goal
First, you need to define the task you want to
achieve. You can think of this as a puzzle for the
computer to solve.   
* Design the script   
To design a script you split the goal out into a series
of tasks that are going to be involved in solving this
puzzle. This can be represented using a flowchart.   
You can then write down individual steps that the computer needs to perform in order to complete each individual task (and any information it needs to perform the task), rather like writing a recipe that it can follow.   
* Code each step   
Each of the steps needs to be written in a
programming language that the compu ter
understands. In our case, this is JavaScript.

A script is a series of instructions that the computer can follow in order to achieve a goal.   
Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of all the instructions.   
Computers approach tasks in a different way than
humans, so your instructions must let the computer
solve the task prggrammatically.   
To approach writing a script, break down your goal into
a series of tasks and then work out each step needed
to complete that task (a flowchart can help).   

# Expressions
there are two types of expressions:   
* expressions that just assign a value to a variable   
In order for a variable to be useful, it needs to be
given a value. As you have seen, this is done using
the assignment operator (the equals sign).   
* expressions that use two or more values to return a single value   
# Operators
* Assignment operator   
Assign a value to a variable   
* arithmetic operator   
Perform basic math   
* String operator   
Combine two strings   
* Comparison operator
Compare two values and return true or false   
* logical operators   
Combine expressions and return true or false   

# Functions
Browsers require very detailed instructions about what
we want them to do. Therefore, complex scripts can run
to hundreds (even thousands) of lines. Programmers use
functions, methods, and objects to organize their code.   
Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a
specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can
reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of st atements).
