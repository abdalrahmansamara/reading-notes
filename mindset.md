<span style="font-family:Papyrus; font-size:4em;">***Growth Mindset***</span>
***
<span style="font-family:Papyrus; font-size:1em;">I'm cheering for you if you're not in a growth mentality yet: you now have the potential to leap to a whole new stage in your personal development. </span>

<span style="font-family:Papyrus; font-size:1em;">It helped me develop in three major ways:</span>

* ## ***Empowered Life***
<span style="font-family:Papyrus; font-size:1em;">Mindset is possibly THE most foundational book for an empowered life. </span>
<span style="font-family:Papyrus; font-size:1em;">
It explains how a fixed mindset will constrain our potential, stunt our growth and condemn us to a life of ego validation and excuse making. </span>
<span style="font-family:Papyrus; font-size:1em;">
I can certainly recall when that was me. And it will show the way out of it with a growth mindset.</span>

***
* ## ***Psychological Understanding***
I am in <span style="font-family:Papyrus; font-size:1em;">Mindset not only kick-started my own self-development but also opened a further door in understanding human psychology.</span>


I am in <span style="font-family:Papyrus; font-size:1em;">Suddenly all the mental games of excuses and blaming used by the men living under the shackles of a fixed mindset made sense.</span>


***
* ## ***Extraordinary is… Doable***
<span style="font-family:Papyrus; font-size:1em;">
A growth mindset also takes away top performance from the realm of “out of this world”, “genius” or whatever you have it and places it within reach of each one of us (willing to put in the work). </span>
<span style="font-family:Papyrus; font-size:1em;">
Because here’s the secret nobody wants you to know: every single top performer busts his ass. And they’re no better than you, and if you put in the work you will do just as extraordinarily.
