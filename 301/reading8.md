# SQL

SQL, or Structured Query Language, is a language designed to allow both technical and non-technical users query, manipulate, and transform data from a relational database. And due to its simplicity, SQL databases provide safe and scalable storage for millions of websites and mobile applications.

## Relational databases

Before learning the SQL syntax, it's important to have a model for what a relational database actually is. A relational database represents a collection of related (two-dimensional) tables. Each of the tables are similar to an Excel spreadsheet, with a fixed number of named columns (the attributes or properties of the table) and any number of rows of data.

For example, if the Department of Motor Vehicles had a database, you might find a table containing all the known vehicles that people in the state are driving. This table might need to store the model name, type, number of wheels, and number of doors of each vehicle for example.

the example shows SQL table and some relations

In such a database, you might find additional related tables containing information such as a list of all registered drivers in the state, the types of driving licenses that can be granted, or even driving violations for each driver.

By learning SQL, the goal is to learn how to answer specific questions about this data, like "What types of vehicles are on the road have less than four wheels?", or "How many models of cars does Tesla produce?", to help us make better decisions down the road.

Since most users will be learning SQL to interact with an existing database, the lessons begin by introducing you to the various parts of an SQL query. The later lessons will then show you how to alter a table (or schema) and create new tables from scratch.

Each lesson will introduce a different concept and end with an interactive exercise. Go at your pace and don't be afraid to spend time experimenting with the exercises before continuing! If you happen to be familiar with SQL already, you can skip ahead using the links in the top-right, but we would recommend you work through the lessons anyways!

## Select

To retrieve data from a SQL database, we need to write SELECT statements, which are often colloquially refered to as queries. A query in itself is just a statement which declares what data we are looking for, where to find it in the database, and optionally, how to transform it before it is returned. It has a specific syntax though, which is what we are going to learn in the following exercises.

## Database normalization

Database normalization is useful because it minimizes duplicate data in any single table, and allows for data in the database to grow independently of each other (ie. Types of car engines can grow independent of each type of car). As a trade-off, queries get slightly more complex since they have to be able to find data from different parts of the database, and performance issues can arise when working with many large tables.

In order to answer questions about an entity that has data spanning multiple tables in a normalized database, we need to learn how to write a query that can combine all that data and pull out exactly the information we need.

Tables that share information about a single entity need to have a primary key that identifies that entity uniquely across the database. One common primary key type is an auto-incrementing integer (because they are space efficient), but it can also be a string, hashed value, so long as it is unique.

As promised in the last lesson, we are going to quickly talk about NULL values in an SQL database. It's always good to reduce the possibility of NULL values in databases because they require special attention when constructing queries, constraints (certain functions behave differently with null values) and when processing the results.

An alternative to NULL values in your database is to have data-type appropriate default values, like 0 for numerical data, empty strings for text data, etc. But if your database needs to store incomplete data, then NULL values can be appropriate if the default values will skew later analysis (for example, when taking averages of numerical data).
