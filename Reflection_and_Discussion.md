# How Pages Use Structure

## Attributes
The attribute name indicates what kind of extra information you are supplying about the element's content. It should be written in lowercase.

The value is the information or setting for the attribute. It should be placed in double quotes. Different attributes can have different values.

## Body, Head & Title
### Body
You met the "body" element in the first example we created. Everything inside this element is shown inside the main browser window.
### Head
Before the "body" element you will often see a "head" element. This contains information about the page (rather than information that is shown within the main part of the browser window that is highlighted in blue on the opposite page). You will usually find a "title" element inside the "head" element.

# The Evolution of HTML
Each new version was designed to be an improvement on the last (with new elements and attributes added and older code removed).

## Doctypes

the doctype command have changed over the years, and it currently an indication of what version of HTML are you working at.

## Comments in HTML 

we can use comments in HTML, but the only one's to see it are the developers themselves, and not the users.
the comment command usually used to indicate something or to leave a remark or a reminder of something.

## ID attributes

Every HTML element can carry the id attribute. It is used to uniquely identify that element from other elements on the page. Its value should start with a letter or an underscore (not a number or any other character). It is important that no two elements on the same page have the same value for their id attributes (otherwise the value is no longer unique).

## Class attributes

Every HTML element can also carry a class attribute. Sometimes, rather than uniquely identifying one element within a document, you will want a way to identify several elements as being different from the other elements on the page.

## Block elements

Some elements will always appear to start on a new line in the browser window. These are known as block level elements.

Examples of block elements are
"h1", "p", "ul", and "li".

## iframes

An iframe is like a little window that has been cut into your page — and in that window you can see another page. The term iframe is an abbreviation of inline frame.

## Escape Characters

There are some characters that are used in and reserved by HTML code. (For example, the left and right angled brackets.)
When using escape characters, it is important to check the page in your browser to ensure that the correct symbol shows up. This is because some fonts do not support all of these characters and you might therefore need to specify a different font for these characters in your CSS code.

# HTML layout

HTML 5 interoduced several commands that distinguishes it from the other versions, like:

* Headers & Footers

headers and footers can be used for The main header or footer that appears at the top or bottom of every page on the site. 

* Navigation

The "nav" element is used to
contain the major navigational
blocks on the site such as the
primary site navigation.

* Articles

The "article" element acts as a container for any section of a page that could stand alone and potentially be syndicated. This could be an individual article or blog entry, a comment or forum post, or any other independent piece of content.

* Figure

It can be used to contain any content that is referenced from the main flow of an article (not just images).

# Process & Design

Every website should be designed for the target audience—not just for yourself or the site owner. It is therefore very important to understand who your target audience is.

Even if the site has a wide appeal, you can still think about the demographics of a sample of the target audience.

## why people visit your website

Now that you know who your visitors are, you need to consider why they are coming. While some people will simply chance across your website, most will visit for a specific reason.

## what your visitors are trying to achive

It is unlikely that you will be able to list every reason why someone visits your site but you are looking for key tasks and motivations. This information can help guide your site designs.

## what information your visitors need?

You know who is coming to your site and why they are coming, so now you need to work out what information they need in order to achieve their goals quickly and effectively.

## how often people will visit your site

Some sites benefit from being updated more frequently than others. Some information (such as news) may be constantly changing, while other content remains relatively static.

## site maps

Now that you know what needs to appear on your site, you can start to organize the information into sections or pages.

## wireframes

A wireframe is a simple sketch of the key information that needs to go on each page of a site. It shows the hierarchy of the information and how much space it might require.

## Visual hierarchy

Most web users do not read entire pages. Rather, they skim to find information. You can use contrast to create a visual hierarchy that gets across your key message and helps users find what they are looking for.

Visual hierarchy refers to the order in which your eyes perceive what they see. It is created by adding visual contrast between the items being displayed. Items with higher contrast are recognized and processed first.

## grouping and Similarity

When making sense of a design, we tend to organize visual elements into groups. Grouping related pieces of information together can make a design easier to comprehend. Here are some ways this can be achieved.

## Designing Navigation

Site navigation not only helps people find where they want to go, but also helps them understand what your site is about and how it is organized. Good navigation tends to follow these principles. .
