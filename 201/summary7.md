# Comparison operators
we have eight comparison operators, all used in order to comapre between two sides:   
* is equal to "=="   
it compares if the value on the right is the smae to the left, regarding the value's type   
* is not equal to "!="   
it compares two values to check if the values are not equal
* strict equal (===)   
Returns true if the operands are equal and of the same type
* strict not equal (!==)   
Returns true if the operands are of the same type but not equal, or are of different type.   
* greater than (>)   
Returns true if the left operand is greater than the right operand.   
* Greater than or equal (>=)   
Returns true if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand.   
* Less than (<)   
Returns true if the left operand is less than the right operand.   
* Less than or equal (<=)   
Returns true if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand.
# Logical operations
we have three logical operations   
* and (&&)   
its used to check if both the conditions are true
* or (||)  
it would return true if one of the values is true
* not (!)   
it would reverse the boolien's condition   
# Loops
they are used for iterations in general   
we have two types of loops, for loop and while loop   
Loops offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly. This chapter of the JavaScript Guide introduces the different iteration statements available to JavaScript.   
A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true.   
If the condition becomes false, statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to the statement following the loop.   
The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed. If the condition returns true, statement is executed and the condition is tested again. If the condition returns false, execution stops, and control is passed to the statement following while.
