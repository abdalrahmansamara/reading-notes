# Version Control

Version Control is a system that allows you to revisit various versions of a file or set of files by recording changes. Through version control, one can revert a file or project to a previous version, track modifications and modifying individuals, and compare changes. By utilizing a Version Control System (VCS), mistakes with files can easily be rectified.

# Distributed Version Control

Since the DVCS allows for several mirrored repositories, team programmers may collaborate with each other in different ways to complete a joint project, allowing different simultaneous workflows to be used.

# Cloning

By cloning the file, you have copied all versions of all files for a project. This command leads to the creation of a directory called “test,” with an initialized .git directory inside it, which has copies of all versions of all files for the specified project. The command also automatically checks out — or retrieves for editing — a copy of the newest version of the project.

# Workflow

The local Git repository has three components:

* Working Directory: The actual files reside here.
* Index: The area used for staging
* Head: Points to the most recent commit

# Remote Repositories

You must interact with remote repositories, versions of a project residing online or on a network in order to collaborate on Git projects. For which you can have read/write or read-only privileges, you can work with multiple repositories. Teams can use remote repositories to push and pull data from information.

## Cloned Repositories

As mentioned earlier, for cloned repositories, Git will automatically give the name “origin” to the server from which you cloned and the name “master” to your local branch.
